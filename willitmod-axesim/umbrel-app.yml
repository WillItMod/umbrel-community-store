  AxeSim is a virtual miner simulator you can use to test AxeLive and AxeBench
  without real hardware. It emulates common miner endpoints and produces
  realistic telemetry, jitter, and fault scenarios. Virtual devices only: it
  does not perform real mining or hashing. Supports up to 10 virtual miners;
  miner ports are exposed on `8091-8100`.

releaseNotes: >-
  Fix: published miner ports no longer auto-create 10 miners in the UI; additional miners are created on-demand when their port is accessed. Add: extra compatibility fields (`model`, `model_name`) to improve AxeLive discovery.
